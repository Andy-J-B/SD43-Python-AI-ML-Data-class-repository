# SD43 - Python AI/ML/Data Class Repository

Welcome, students! 👋

This is the official GitHub repository for our Python: AI/ML/Data class. This repository will be our central hub for all the code, projects, and resources we build together this semester.

## 🚀 Course Overview

This course is a project-based introduction to the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Think of it as a university-level "Introduction to AI" course, but with a twist: we learn everything by building practical, hands-on projects.

Our goal isn't just to *use* AI, but to *understand* how it thinks, learns, and makes decisions.

## 🧠 What We'll Learn

We will cover a wide range of foundational AI and ML topics. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of:

* **Core AI Concepts:** What is AI? We'll explore knowledge representation (how AI understands the world) and logical inference (how AI "reasons").
* **Intelligent Searching:** How does a GPS find the best route? We'll study **search trees** and other planning algorithms that help AIs find optimal solutions.
* **Game-Playing AI:** How does a computer play (and beat) humans in games like Chess or Checkers? We'll build our own game-playing agents using algorithms like **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.
* **Machine Learning (ML):** How do machines learn from data? We'll dive into foundational models like:
    * **Decision Trees:** Simple, flowchart-like models for making predictions.
    * **Neural Networks:** The building blocks of "Deep Learning" that power everything from image recognition to language translation.
* **Ethics & Philosophy:** As we build these powerful tools, we'll also discuss the important ethical questions and philosophical ideas surrounding AI.

## 💻 How Our Class Works

Our class is built on a "learn by doing" philosophy. Here’s what to expect each week:

1.  **Project-Based Learning**
    Each week, we'll start a new project (or continue a larger one). We learn new concepts *because* we need them to build our project. You won't just learn *what* a neural network is; you'll learn *how* to build one to solve a problem.

2.  **"Step-by-Step" Live Coding**
    We will write all our code *together* during our Zoom class.
    * I'll type one or two lines of code at a time and explain what each line does.
    * You'll copy the same code on your computer.
    * I'll pause regularly to make sure everyone has completed the step before we move on.
    * We'll run our code frequently to see the results and debug any errors as a team. This is the best way to learn real-world problem-solving!

## 📂 How to Use This Repository

This repository is your "source of truth" for all class code.

* **After Class:** I will push the final, working code for each lesson into this repository *after* our class is over.
* **Missed a Class?** If you miss a class, you can come here to find the completed project code.
* **Got Stuck?** If you have a bug you can't solve or fell behind during our live coding, you can use the code here to find the solution and get caught up.
* **Review:** Use the code here to review what we did, experiment on your own, and build on our projects.

Each project will be in its own clearly named folder (e.g., `Week1_Minimax_TicTacToe`, `Week2_DecisionTree`).

## ❓ Questions?

If you have questions about the code, a concept, or a bug in your project, please bring them to the beginning of our next class!
