# SD43 - Python AI/ML/Data Class Repository

Welcome, students! üëã

This is the official GitHub repository for our Python: AI/ML/Data class. This repository will be our central hub for all the code, projects, and resources we build together this semester.

## üöÄ Course Overview

This course is a project-based introduction to the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Think of it as a university-level "Introduction to AI" course.

Our goal isn't just to *use* AI, but to *understand* how it thinks, learns, and makes decisions.

## üß† What We'll Learn

We will cover a wide range of foundational AI and ML topics. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of:

* **Core AI Concepts:** What is AI? We'll explore knowledge representation (how AI understands the world) and logical inference (how AI "reasons").
* **Intelligent Searching:** How does a GPS find the best route? We'll study **search trees** and other planning algorithms that help AIs find optimal solutions.
* **Game-Playing AI:** How does a computer play (and beat) humans in games like Chess or Checkers? We'll build our own game-playing agents using algorithms like **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.
* **Machine Learning (ML):** How do machines learn from data? We'll dive into foundational models like:
    * **Decision Trees:** Simple, flowchart-like models for making predictions.
    * **Neural Networks:** The building blocks of "Deep Learning" that power everything from image recognition to language translation.

## üìÇ How to Use This Repository

This repository is your "source of truth" for all class code.

* **After Class:** I will push the final, working code for each lesson into this repository *after* our class is over.
* **Missed a Class?** If you miss a class, you can come here to find the completed project code.
* **Got Stuck?** If you have a bug you can't solve or fell behind during our live coding, you can use the code here to find the solution and get caught up.
* **Review:** Use the code here to review what we did, experiment on your own, and build on our projects.

Each project will be in its own clearly named folder (e.g., `Week1_Minimax_TicTacToe`, `Week2_DecisionTree`).

## ‚ùì Questions?

If you have questions about the code, a concept, or a bug in your project, please bring them to the beginning of our next class!
